# Supercon SAO Projects

Each year the Hackaday Supercon conference designs a unique badge that attendees can wear but also program.  While every year's badge is very different, they all incorporate an
add-on interface (called the ["Supercon Add-On"](https://hackaday.io/project/175182-simple-add-ons-sao) or "SAO") that exposes power and digital communications in a standadized configuration.

I'm attending Supercon for the first time in 2024 and am keen to try my hand at badge programming and SAO development. This repo serves as a collection point for software and hardware designs in support of my SAO voyage of discovery.  Everything is organized by year, as the badge, badge programming environment, and documentation changes every year.
