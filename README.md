# Supercon SAO Projects

Each year the Hackaday Supercon conference designs a unique badge that attendees can wear but also program.  While every year's badge is very different, they all incorporate an
add-on interface (called the ["Supercon Add-On"](https://hackaday.io/project/175182-simple-add-ons-sao) or "SAO") that exposes power and digital communications in a standardized configuration.

I'm attending Supercon for the first time in 2024 and am keen to try my hand at badge programming and SAO development. This repo serves as a collection point for software and hardware designs in support of my SAO voyage of discovery.  Everything is organized by year, as the badge, badge programming environment, and documentation changes every year.

Part of the challenge in developing an SAO add-on is that details of the badge are not released until about four weeks before the conference.  It pays, therefore, to be as prepared as possible but also stay flexible so you can react and probably re-design once actual badge specifications are known.

My newbie attempt for 2024 is to build an add-on that monitors air quality around the  badge wearer and uses a simple "stoplight" with red, yellow and green LEDs to translate current CO2 levels into subjective "good" (green), "warning" (yellow) and "alert!" (red) values.  We'll see how that goes...
